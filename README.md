Responsive Layouts:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a responsive layout in a Flutter application. The application adapts to different screen sizes to provide an optimal user experience on various devices. The Todo list application from the previous weeks is enhanced with a responsive layout that adjusts the display of the todo list and the detailed view of selected items based on the screen size.
